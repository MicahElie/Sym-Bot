## Interface
The interface is built thanks to guizero, an easy to install (and to use) module.
Note to self: to integrate the Interface into the code, we must include the file. Don't forget to display() at the end. The update_command function must be used in the main to change the functions attached to the buttons. We must link the labels of X, Y, Z, J1, J2 and J3 so that it shows real time values. We must also make variables that will be linked to the state of the gripper and wether we are in Cartesian or Joint mode. We should add an update function so that the info can stay up-to-date. -Fred
