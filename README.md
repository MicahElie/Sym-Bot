## Project context
This project came up from the desire to help people with disabilities to take or move objects out of reach. 
More pricesly, some of these people don't have enough strength in their arms to strech them out. Fortunately, most of the times, they can at least move their hands.
That's the core of the Symbot Project : Using a glove with sensors to control a robotic arm in the most intuitive way as possible, working in Symbiose with the user.

## Objectives
Our robotic harm is a simple 3 degrees of freedom robot. The goal is to accomplish simple tasks only by using the "Glove controler". Here are four things we want to do:
1. Push/Pull an object on table, placed in front of our robot
2. Turn an interuptor On/Off, the interuptor being on the table
3. Take a cellphone (200g max.) and keep it in the air
4. Using AI to predict moves based on hand signs that we created

## Important Note
Make sure to read all documentation linked with what you want to work on. 
We'll do anything we can for the documentation to be as clear as possible, but we can't garanty that it's going to work with your application.
